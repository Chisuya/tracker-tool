2. **Extract** the ZIP file to a folder
3. **Run** 'TimeTool.exe'
4. **Authorize** Google Calendar when browser opens (one time only)

**Important:** Keep all files together in the SAME folder or the app will not track properly

## Quick Start
1. Run 'TimeTool.exe'
2. Browser opens -> Sign into Google
3. Click "Allow" (again, you only need to authorize once)
4. Start tracking!

## To Sync with Apple Calendar
1. Open System Settings (or System Preferences)
2. Click "Internet Accounts"
3. Click "Google" (or the + button and select Google)
4. Sign in with the SAME Google account you authorized the app with
5. Make sure "Calendars" is checked
6. Click "Done"
7. On Apple Calendar...
7.1 Look in the sidebar for "Time Tool" calendar
7.2 Check the bbox next to it to show your tracked time!
7.3 Events should sync automatically and work across all iOS devices once you added your Google Acc!

## Privacy & Security
- All data is stored **locally** on your computer
- Calendar sync only accesses **your calendar**
- No data collected or sent anywhere else, I will NOT have access to it
- **Open source**, so you can verify the code yourself!

## System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- 50 MB disk space (it's large due to the dependencies bundled inside)
- Wifi (for Google Calendar sync)

## Known Issues
- First launch may take 10-20 seconds
- Windows Defender may give a security warning (click "More info" -> "Run anyway")
- Google shows "unverified app" warning during authorization (that's normal and it's safe)
